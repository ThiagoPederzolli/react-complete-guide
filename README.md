# React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)

This course covers React.js comprehensively, from fundamentals to advanced topics, with a practical, project-based approach. It includes multiple demo applications and follows the latest React 19 patterns and best practices.


#### Core topics covered:

- React fundamentals: components, props, hooks, state management
- Advanced patterns: Context API, Redux Toolkit, custom hooks
- Fullstack development with Next.js 14+ and React Server Components
- Routing, authentication, form handling, and HTTP requests
- Professional practices: TypeScript, testing, styling, deployment

## [00-starting-js-proj]()
A comprehensive JavaScript fundamentals review covering modern ES6+ syntax and concepts essential for React development. This module focuses on understanding how React projects differ from vanilla JavaScript and the build process involved.

#### Key topics covered:

- Modern JavaScript syntax: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator
- ES6 modules: import/export statements
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce) crucial for React
- Functions as values and higher-order functions
- Objects, classes, and reference vs primitive values
- DOM manipulation concepts (and why React handles it differently)
- Control structures and operators

## [01-starting-project]()
An in-depth exploration of React's core concepts, building a solid foundation in component-based architecture, state management, and dynamic UI rendering. This module covers everything from creating basic components to handling events and managing application state.

#### Key topics covered:

- Components & JSX: Creating reusable components, understanding the component tree
- Props & composition: Making components flexible with props, children prop, and component composition
- Event handling: Responding to user interactions, passing functions as props, custom event arguments
- State management: Using hooks (useState), deriving data from state, updating UI reactively
- Dynamic rendering: Conditional content, rendering lists dynamically, dynamic styling
- Best practices: Project structure, file organization, component splitting strategies
- Advanced patterns: Fragments, forwarding props, multiple JSX slots, dynamic component types, default prop values

## [Tic-Tac-Toe Game]()
A fully functional two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React, focusing on advanced state management patterns and component composition. The game features player name customization, turn-based gameplay, win/draw detection, and a complete game-over screen with restart functionality.
#### Key topics covered:
- State management patterns: Lifting state up, deriving computed values, avoiding unnecessary state
- Immutable state updates: Properly updating arrays and objects without mutations
- Component architecture: Splitting components by feature, creating reusable UI elements, component isolation
- Two-way binding: Managing user input for dynamic player names
- Advanced rendering: Multi-dimensional lists (game board), conditional content rendering
- State derivation: Computing values from other computed values, reducing state complexity
- Best practices: Updating state based on previous state, avoiding intersecting states, data organization in separate files

## [Investment Calculator]()
A financial calculator application that computes investment returns over time based on user inputs. Built independently to reinforce React fundamentals, featuring dynamic calculations, real-time updates, and a clean user interface for financial planning.

#### Key topics covered:

- Component composition: Fragments, flexible components with prop forwarding, multiple JSX slots
- State management: Two-way binding for form inputs, lifting state for shared data access
- Dynamic rendering: Conditional content display, rendering calculated results dynamically
- Computed values: Deriving financial calculations from state without unnecessary re-renders
- Immutable state updates: Properly managing complex state objects
- Component patterns: Dynamic component types, default prop values, component splitting strategies
- Best practices: Separating data logic, avoiding redundant state, efficient state derivation

## [CSS Module Project]()
A comprehensive exploration of different styling approaches in React, from vanilla CSS to modern CSS-in-JS solutions and utility-first frameworks. This project demonstrates the implementation of the same application using multiple styling methodologies, comparing their strengths, limitations, and use cases.

#### Key topics covered:

- Vanilla CSS: Splitting CSS across multiple files, understanding global scope limitations, pros and cons
- Inline styles: Dynamic and conditional styling with JavaScript objects, performance considerations
- CSS Modules: Scoping CSS rules to components, preventing style conflicts, local vs global styles
- Styled Components: CSS-in-JS approach, creating flexible styled components, component-based styling
- Advanced Styled Components: Pseudo selectors, nested rules, media queries, dynamic props-based styling
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first framework setup, responsive design with media queries, pseudo selectors
- Dynamic styling patterns: Conditional classes, dynamic inline styles, props-based styling across different approaches
- Component architecture: Creating reusable styled components, component combinations, maintaining flexibility
- Comparison & best practices: Evaluating pros and cons of each approach, choosing the right styling solution

## [Debugging Investment Calculator]()
### React Debugging & Developer Tools
A focused project on mastering debugging techniques and tools essential for React development. This module emphasizes identifying, diagnosing, and resolving common React errors through systematic debugging approaches and professional developer tools.

#### Key topics covered:

- Error diagnosis: Reading and understanding React error messages, stack traces, and warnings
- Browser debugging: Using browser DevTools debugger, setting breakpoints, stepping through code
- React Strict Mode: Understanding double-rendering behavior, identifying side effects, development vs production mode
- React DevTools: Component tree inspection, props and state debugging, performance profiling
